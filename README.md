Greetings, my name is Esteban and I'm from Buenos Aires. I've been a graphic designer for over 10 years 
and a front-end web developer (with the goal of becoming a full-stack developer). I am currently in the 
second year of a Technical Degree in Web and App Development and I have also taken some courses, such as
a full-stack course from Codo a Codo. I love programming and designing. I am passionate about 
English (British English), volleyball, tennis, and football (Premier League and WSL).
